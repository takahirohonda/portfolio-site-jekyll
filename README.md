## (1) Architecture Overview

- HTML: Using Jekyll to generate static site
- CSS: Using sass and gulp to compile & minify
- JS: For non-react page, using TypeScript and gulp & rollup to compile & minify
- React: Using TypeScript and Webpack

## (2) Local Dev Environment Setup

```

2. Run npm install after install Node.js for both code and react projects

```

## (3) Folder Structure

```bash
_include # this is where partial html fragments are defined 
_layouts # this is where Jekyll layouts are defined
_site # not commited, jekyll generate static site to this folder
assets # static assests - where react bundle, css bundle, js bundles are pushed. Images are directly added and source controlled
code # where we develop css and js. Bundle will be pushed to assets/js and assets/css folders
prototype # where we use it to prototype front end look
react # where we develop react. Bundle will be pushed to assets/js folder 

404.html # error page
index.html # entrypoint, using default template
*.html # other pages
```
