# portfolio-site-jekyll

Portfolio static site generated by jekyll

## (1) Architecture Overview

- HTML: Using Jekyll to generate static site
- CSS: Using sass and gulp to compile & minify
- JS: For non-react page, using TypeScript and gulp & rollup to compile & minify
- React: Using TypeScript and Webpack

## (2) Local Dev Environment Setup

- Ruby: ~> 2.6.6
- Node.js: ~> 12.14

1. Install Jekyll after installing Ruby

```bash
gem install bundler jekyll
```

2. Run npm install after install Node.js for both code and react projects

```bash
cd code
npm i
cd ..

cd react
npm i
```

## (3) Folder Structure

```bash
_include # this is where partial html fragments are defined 
_layouts # this is where Jekyll layouts are defined
_site # not commited, jekyll generate static site to this folder
assets # static assests - where react bundle, css bundle, js bundles are pushed. Images are directly added and source controlled
code # where we develop css and js. Bundle will be pushed to assets/js and assets/css folders
prototype # where we use it to prototype front end look
react # where we develop react. Bundle will be pushed to assets/js folder 

404.html # error page
index.html # entrypoint, using default template
*.html # other pages
```

## (4) Build

There are 3 steps to build the Jekyll site.

1. Build js and css bundle from /code
2. Build react bundle from /react
3. Build Jekyll site

```bash
cd code
npm run deploy:prod
cd ..
cd react
npm run build
cd ..
jekyll build 

# Local development
# may need to use bundle exec jekyll serve for the firs time
# may need to run `bundle install`
jekyll serve --host localhot

# for local js and css hot loading
npm run watch
```

# Tips

chaining or in where_exp can be only done two

this works.

```
{% assign writingList = site.posts 
  | where_exp: "post", "post.title == site.data.carousel.carouselItems.creativeWriting[0] 
  or post.title == site.data.carousel.carouselItems.creativeWriting[1]"
%}
```

this errors

```
{% assign writingList = site.posts 
  | where_exp: "post", "post.title == site.data.carousel.carouselItems.creativeWriting[0] 
  or post.title == site.data.carousel.carouselItems.creativeWriting[1]
  or post.title == site.data.carousel.carouselItems.creativeWriting[2]"
%}

```

We can reverse sorting (meaning in an ascending order). Post used to be sorted in ascending order. Now without reversed, this becomes descending (which is the default behaviour). 

```
{% for post in site.posts reversed %}
```

# Deployment Error

This suddenly started happening...

Removed Gemfile.lock and it worked. I think it was a bundler update and bundler version in the lock file got outdated.

```
usr/lib/ruby/2.5.0/rubygems.rb:289:in `find_spec_for_exe': can't find gem bundler (>= 0.a) with executable bundle (Gem::GemNotFoundException)
	from /usr/lib/ruby/2.5.0/rubygems.rb:308:in `activate_bin_path'
	from /usr/local/bin/bundle:23:in `<main>'
```
